hello world, my name is Andres Morales, I am 20 years old and I live in Bogota, Colombia,
I am studying an undergraduate degree in agronomic engineering at the National University of Colombia, 
and I am learning in MisionTIC 2021 because I like programming and I would like to work on something related.
I like to spend my time reading literature books and watching series and movies
